In this assignment let's build a **Admin-UI** given by geekTrust.

FINAL LINk:--
https://Adminkr.ccbp.tech

GUIDELINES:--

These are the requirements:

1. Column titles must stand out from the entries.

2. There should be a search bar that can filter on any property.

3. You should be able to edit or delete rows in place.(There is no expectation of persistence. Edit and delete are expected to only happen in memory.)

4. You need to implement pagination: Each page contains 10 rows. Buttons at the bottom allow you to jump to any page including special buttons for first page, previous page, next page and last page. Pagination must update based on search/filtering. If there are 25 records for example that match a search query, then pagination buttons should only go till 3.

5. You should be able to select one or more rows. A selected row is highlighted with a grayish background color. Multiple selected rows can be deleted at once using the 'Delete Selected' button at the bottom left.

6. Checkbox on the top left is a shortcut to select or deselect all displayed rows. This should only apply to the ten rows displayed in the current page, and not all 50 rows.

Users API:

We provide you an Users API to list all the users and their properties.

Note: The users are sorted by `id` field. There is no alphabetical sorting.

Endpoint: https://geektrust.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/adminui-problem/members.json

Request Type: GET

Sample Response:

[ { "id": "1", "name": "Aaron Miles", "email": "aaron@mailinator.com", "role": "member" }, { "id": "2", "name": "Aishwarya Naik", "email": "aishwarya@mailinator.com", "role": "member" }, { "id": "3", "name": "Arvind Kumar", "email": "arvind@mailinator.com", "role": "admin" } ]

Take a look at Geektrust help docs for guidance on how to write code that will companies interested in you. All the best!

You should read what we look for in your solution before you start coding.

Getting Started with Create React App This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts In the project directory, you can run:

npm start Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Learn More You can learn more in the Create React App documentation.
